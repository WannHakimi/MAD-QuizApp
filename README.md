## HOW TO RUN

1. Install Git: If you haven't already, download and install Git on your computer from the official website (https://git-scm.com/downloads). Follow the installation instructions for your specific operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux).
2. Clone the GitHub repository: Navigate to the GitHub repository containing the Android Studio project you want to run. Click on the green "Code" button and copy the repository URL. Open a terminal or command prompt on your computer, navigate to the directory where you want to clone the project, and run the following command:
```bash
git clone <repository_URL>
``` 
3. Replace <repository_URL> with the URL you copied from GitHub.
4. Launch Android Studio: Open Android Studio and wait for the welcome screen to appear.
5. Open the cloned project: Click on "Open an Existing Project" and navigate to the directory where you cloned the GitHub repository. Select the project folder and click "OK" to open the project in Android Studio.
Configure the project: Ensure that your project is properly configured with the correct SDK version, build tools, and dependencies. You can check and modify these settings in the build.gradle files (Module and Project level) and the app's AndroidManifest.xml file. Android Studio may prompt you to update or install missing components; follow the instructions to do so.
6. Sync the project: Click on the "Sync Project with Gradle Files" button (a circular arrow icon) in the toolbar or press Ctrl + Shift + Y. This will sync the project with the Gradle build system and download any required dependencies.
7. Connect a device or emulator: To run your app, you'll need either a physical Android device connected to your computer or an Android emulator. For a physical device, enable USB debugging in the Developer Options and connect it to your computer via USB. For an emulator, click on "AVD Manager" in the toolbar, create a new virtual device or select an existing one, and click on the green play button to start the emulator.
8. Build and run the app: In Android Studio, click on the green "Run" button (a triangle icon) in the toolbar or press Shift + F10. This will build your app and launch it on the connected device or emulator.
